# Pandas Sales Data Project

Here we do some basic data cleaning and plotting using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn

We have a table with Date,Product,Category,Revenue,Units_Sold where we run basic groupby queries using pandas to aggregate revenue per day and per product. This little example was to learn the basics of pandas.
